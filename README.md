### 🧠 About Kriya

**KriyaLab** is not a demo playground. It’s a showcase of real systems built for  
**real-world use** by a real architect.

This space is led by **Arindam Kar**, a global IT veteran with 23+ years of experience across India, Singapore, UAE, and Bahrain — formerly with **IBM**, **HP**, and **POORTI**.

Here you'll find:
- Political campaign engines powered by AI
- Document pipelines (OCR → LLM → Excel)
- Founder vetting tools with VET–SCOPE–LAUNCH workflows
- Fully offline, multilingual AI tools

All built for **impact**, not hype.
